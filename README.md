This is a repository showcasing my understanding and comfort with cleaning data and analyzing it (and visualizing data)
through the use of Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn

All Activities are split by a keyword "TASK" which helps me showcase how I'd go about solving each situation

## Netflix Dataset
In this project, I looked at a Netflix Dataset with over 7000 rows and 11 columns. I go through the process of data cleaning, manipulation and data discovery where I learned about some data entry errors and overcome them. Also discovered were some of the complications with defining "Duration" and I looked into data related to multiple categories and types of content. Finally, the use of data visualizations were key at some parts of my data discovery as it helped illustrate my point while also showcasing my ability to use libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
